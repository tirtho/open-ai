Notably, net realized gains surged by 64.5% to $18,200 million. Overall, the net investment gain improved by 13.5%, amounting to $71,132 million. However, the investment yield slightly decreased by 0.15 percentage points to 2.60%.\n",

      "\n",

      "5. **Combined Ratio**: The combined ratio, which measures the overall underwriting profitability, increased by 0.9 percentage points to 99.6% in 2021, up from 98.7% in 2020. This suggests a slight deterioration in underwriting performance, as a combined ratio above 100% indicates an underwriting loss.\n",
